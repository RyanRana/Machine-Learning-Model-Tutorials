<h1>Machine-Learning-Model-Tutorials</h1>
<p>Here is a collection of comprehensive tutorial I wrote on some of the most important machine learning models. They include conceptual information, a project build, data source, and source code. </p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://theryanrana.medium.com/the-simplest-guide-to-support-vector-machines-cf380568c3a6?">The Simplest Guide to Support Vector Machines.</a></h3>
<p>Support Vector Machines(SVM) are one the most frequently used machine learning models, and definitely essential for any ML developer's toolkit. The goal of this article isn’t just to simply teach you what SVM’s are but also how to build one with python.</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://theryanrana.medium.com/the-simplest-guide-to-naive-bayes-classifiers-b57c170cc9e9?">The Simplest Guide to Naive Bayes Classifiers.</a></h3>
<p>The Naive Bayes algorithm is one of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms out there. The goal of this article is to not only teach you how Naive Bayes works but also how to build one with Python.</p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://theryanrana.medium.com/the-simplest-guide-to-neural-networks-5faa74dd01d5">The Simplest Guide to Neural Networks.</a></h3>
<p>An article post that informs the reader of general information regarding Neural Networks as well as how to build one with Python. The problem set takes in practice hours and working hours to predict ones performance in a football game, but the coding is highly flexible so it can be implemented in many different ways.</p>
